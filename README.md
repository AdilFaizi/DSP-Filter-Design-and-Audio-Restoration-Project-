# DSP-Filter-Design-and-Audio-Restoration-Project-
This project implements a complete digital signal processing workflow for FIR filter design and audio noise removal. Using MATLAB and Python, a bandpass FIR filter is designed based on strict passband/stopband ripple specifications, followed by multi-method restoration of a noisy music signal.
